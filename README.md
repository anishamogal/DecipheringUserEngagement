# Deciphering User Engagement

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis conducted using JMP Pro statistical software to decipher user engagement rates. Various statistical tests, including Two-Sample T-Test (Equality of Means), Simple Linear Regression, Paired T-Test, and Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit, have been performed on the provided dataset.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the 'UserEngagementData.csv' file within this repository. It includes variables related to user engagement metrics, such as time spent on the platform, engagement rate, frequency of posting, and preferred content. The dataset comprises [number of observations] rows of data.

## Statistical Analysis
### Two-Sample T-Test (Equality of Means)
This test was conducted to determine whether there is a significant difference in engagement rates between two groups based on their locality. The null hypothesis assumes that there is no difference in means between the groups.

### Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression was performed to model the relationship between two variables, such as time spent on the platform and user engagement. This analysis helps understand how changes in one variable affect the other.

### Paired T-Test
The paired t-test was utilized to compare the means of two related groups, such as engagement rates before and after a feature introduction. This test is useful for assessing the effectiveness of changes or features over time.

### Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit
The chi-square test was employed to assess whether the observed distribution of categorical variables fits a theoretical distribution. In this context, it was used to analyze the goodness of the proportion of users across different age groups.

## Results
The results of the statistical analyses are summarized in the 'AnishaMogal_Project' file. This file provides detailed findings, including statistical significance, effect sizes, and confidence intervals, for each test conducted.

### Summary of Key Findings:
- The Two-Sample T-Test revealed a significant difference in engagement rates between users from different localities, suggesting that geographic location influences user engagement.
- The Paired T-Test did not show a statistically significant improvement in engagement rates after the introduction of a new feature, suggesting that the feature might not have had a significant impact on user engagement.
- Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit revealed that the distribution of users across different age groups deviates significantly from the expected distribution, indicating potential age-related preferences or behaviors influencing engagement.

## Conclusion
Based on the analyses conducted, conclusions regarding user engagement rates and the factors influencing them can be drawn. Recommendations for further action or strategies to optimize user engagement may also be suggested based on the findings.

## Future Work
Future work may involve further exploration of the dataset, additional statistical analyses, or validation of findings through experimentation or data collection. Potential directions for future analysis include:
- Conducting multivariate regression analysis to identify the combined effect of multiple variables on user engagement.
- Exploring interaction effects between different demographic variables (e.g., age and locality) on engagement rates.
- Implementing predictive modeling techniques to forecast future user engagement trends and patterns.
- Collecting qualitative data through surveys or interviews to gain insights into user preferences and behaviors that may influence engagement.
- Investigating the impact of external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, seasonal trends) on user engagement to optimize engagement strategies.
