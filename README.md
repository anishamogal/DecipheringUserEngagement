# DecipheringUserEngagement

# JMP Pro Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis conducted using JMP Pro statistical software to decipher user engagement rates. Various statistical tests including Two-Sample T-Test (Equality of Means), Simple Linear Regression, Paired T-Test, and Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit have been performed on the provided dataset.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the 'data' directory within this repository. It includes the necessary variables related to user engagement metrics, such as time spent on the platform, actions taken, demographic information, etc.

## Statistical Analysis
### Two-Sample T-Test (Equality of Means)
This test was conducted to determine whether there is a significant difference in engagement rates between two groups. The null hypothesis assumes that there is no difference in means between the groups.

### Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression was performed to model the relationship between two variables, such as time spent on the platform and user engagement. This analysis helps understand how changes in one variable affect the other.

### Paired T-Test
The paired t-test was utilized to compare the means of two related groups, such as engagement rates before and after an intervention. This test is useful for assessing the effectiveness of changes or interventions over time.

### Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit
The chi-square test was employed to assess whether the observed distribution of categorical variables fits a theoretical distribution. In this context, it was used to analyze the goodness of fit of user engagement across different demographic groups.

## Results
The results of the statistical analyses are summarized in the 'results' directory. Detailed findings, including statistical significance, effect sizes, and confidence intervals, are provided for each test conducted.

## Conclusion
Based on the analyses conducted, conclusions regarding user engagement rates and the factors influencing them can be drawn. Recommendations for further action or strategies to optimize user engagement may also be suggested based on the findings.

## Future Work
Future work may involve further exploration of the dataset, additional statistical analyses, or validation of findings through experimentation or data collection.
